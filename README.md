Using this package you can create beautiful dashboards. The dashboard consists of tile which are, under the hood, Livewire components that can update themselves via polling. 

This package contains the base functionality:

- the base css
- a `dashboard` view component
- a `tile` view component to position stuff on the dashboard
- a `Tile` model to persist fetched data that tiles can use to store fetched data
