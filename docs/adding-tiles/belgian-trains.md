## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-dashboard-belgian-trains-tile
```

In the `dashboard` config file, you must add this configuration in the `tiles` key. The value `belgian_trains` should be an array of which each value is array with keys `departure`, `destination` and `label`

```php
// in config/dashboard.php

return [
    // ...
    'tiles' => [
        'belgian_trains' => [
            'connections' => [
                [
                    'departure' => 'Antwerpen-Centraal',
                    'destination' => 'Gent-Dampoort',
                    'label' => 'Gent',
                ],
            ],
            'refresh_interval_in_seconds' => 60,
        ],
    ],
];
```

In `app\Console\Kernel.php` you should schedule the `Spatie\BelgianTrainsTile\FetchBelgianTrainsCommand` to run. You can let in run every minute if you want. You could also run is less frequently if you fast updates on the dashboard aren't that important for this tile.

```php
// in app/console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // ...
    $schedule->command(Spatie\BelgianTrainsTile\FetchBelgianTrainsCommand::class)->everyMinute();
}
```

## Usage

In your dashboard view you use the `livewire:velo-tile` component. 

```html
<x-dashboard>
    <livewire:belgian-trains-tile position="a1:a3" />
</x-dashboard>
```

### Customizing the view

If you want to customize the view used to render this tile, run this command:

```bash

```
